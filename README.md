# django-project
## Comparsion with Flask

* similar points: 
  * jinja2: Passing parameter into html is same.
  * model to define the table

* not similar points:
  * MVT vs MVC
  * ORM vs Sqlachemy  
  * Encrypto: Django admin mode auto takes care of the password encrypto. In Flask, we have to define the hash encrypto by ourselves.
